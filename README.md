## 1. Project Description

The aim of this project was to create an app to predict the possibility an individual is infected by COVID-19 by looking at the external symptoms they exhibit, such as coughing or fever.

To run the project, please download the source code and follow the instructions.

## 2. Main Packages and Libraries Used

- [PyIT2FLS](https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- TKinter

## 3. Setup Instructions

1. Tested to be working on Python 3.7 and Python 3.8
2. Install all the necessary dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Execute the main file.
```
python main.py run
```
